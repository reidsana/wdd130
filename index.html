        <p>Hello! My name is Oksana Reid, and I am from Jamaica. I enjoy reading and spending time in nature, especially
            walking outdoors. I am currently studying software and web development at BYU Idaho.
            I am excited to learn more about web development, how it works, and the possibilities it offers.
            I look forward to creating my own website and gaining a deeper understanding of the industry.
            I am enthusiastic about what the future holds and am eager to see where my skills and passion will take me.
        </p>
